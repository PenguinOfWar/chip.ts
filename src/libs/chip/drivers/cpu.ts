     * We're creating a hexidecimal here, I guess? Out of the two byte opcode

     * we also take the next byte which is conveniently 02 hex / 2 decimal
     *
     * fuck me
     * i guess this is a clever way of storing integers greater than 8 bits
     * which is cool as shit
     *
     * we take decimal 106 and we shift it left 8 places giving us decimal 27136
     *
     * then we take output of that left shift and give it to a bitwise OR - the single pipe dude
     * this guy adds them together
     * problem: 27136 | 2
     * result: 27138 decimal / 6a02 hex

     * i guess we just got two bytes of storage out of one byte of data
